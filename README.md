# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust

How to run with cargo examples: 
* `cargo run <day> <input file>`
* `cargo watch -x check -x "run <day> <input file>"`

I find this programming language very interesting so I decided to participate in the Advent of Code 2022 with it. Still learning so things might be more imperative than an experienced Rust user chaining crazy functional programming methods.

The input file parameter will read them from the root directory. Not using it will use hardcoded paths, but since they are in a private repo it's not recommended unless you change them yourself in the code.
